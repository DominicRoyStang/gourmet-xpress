General Workflow with Git:

FIRST TIME USE:
    
    1. Get added to the repository 
        Send your GitHub username on slack
    
    2. Clone the repository
        git clone https://github.com/<YourGithubUsername>/gourmet-xpress.git

    3. Locally store the remote repository as 'origin' (might be done automatically as you clone)
        git remote add origin https://github.com/<YourGithubUsername>/gourmet-xpress.git
    

GENERAL WORKFLOW:

    1. Get a task assigned to you
    
    2. Create a local branch for your task
        git checkout -b "<branch-name>"

    3. Push the branch to the remote repository
        git push -u origin "<branch-name>"
    
    4. Start writing code

    5. Look at the list your changed files
        git status
    
    6. Add all changed files and commit them locally
        git add .
        git commit -m "<description of changes>"
    
    7. Push your changes to the remote repository
        git push
    
    8. Repeat steps 4-7 as needed

    9. When your code is ready to be used by others, create a pull request on Github
